### TWITTER SCRAPPING

This project aims to scrape Twitter data using the snscrape library, store it in MongoDB, and display the scraped data in a GUI built with Streamlit. The user can enter a keyword or hashtag to search, select a date range, and limit the number of tweets to scrape. The scraped data is displayed in the GUI and can be uploaded to the database, downloaded as a CSV or JSON file.
